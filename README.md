PDO-Sync
========

Synchronize between 2 databases with PDO.

## Example

The following example will copy all tables

```php

$source = [
    'host'=>'localhost',
    'username'=>'username',
    'password'=>'P4SSW0RD',
    'database'=>'localdb'
];

$target = [
    'host'=>'remote.example.com',
    'username'=>'remote_user',
    'password'=>'P4SSW0RD',
    'database'=>'remotedb'
];

$sourcePDO = new \PDO(sprintf('mysql:host=%s;dbname=%s;', $source['host'], $source['database']), $source['username'], $source['password']);
$targetPDO = new \PDO(sprintf('mysql:host=%s;dbname=%s;', $target['host'], $target['database']), $target['username'], $target['password']);
$logger = new \Psr\Log\NullLogger();

$sync = new \Mducharme\PDOSync\Synchronizer($sourcePDO, $targetPDO, $logger);

// Synchronize all tables
$results = $sync();

// Only synchronize 2 explicit tables
$results = $sync(['table1', 'table2']);
```

> Note that although this example demonstrates that the `Synchronizer` object is invokable,
> it can be also run with a method: `$results = $sync->run($tables);`.

## How it works

This script copies all table data from a database (`source`) to another database (`target`).

> Because it uses PDO for all operations, it can synchronize databases across 2 servers. As long as it can connect, it should be able to synchronize. 

> Note that synchronizations across 2 different drivers might work but is **unsupported**.

It first ensures that the table structure of the tables across both databases match, 
then it creates a backup of the target's table and then deletes all the data (`truncate`). 
It then fetch all the data from the source and inserts it in the target.
If any error occurs, it restores the data from the backup, otherwise it deletes the backup.

It returns an array containing the results as `skipped`, `errored` or `synced` (success).

 - If a target table does not exist, it will be created.
 - If a source table does not exist, it will be skipped.
 - If a target table's structure is not exactly like the source's, it will be skipped.

> This class **can** contain bugs that result in loss of data in certain scenarios.
> Test thoroughly before using in a live environment; **at your own risk, there is no warranty**.
